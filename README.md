# FrameSnapper
A LiveSplit plugin that snaps your split times to the nearest multiple of 1/60th of a second. Use in conjunction with AutoSplit in a 60 fps game to ensure accurate split times in LiveSplit.

# Usage
After installing the plugin, simply add it to your layout for it to work. It doesn't have any configuration tab for now.
